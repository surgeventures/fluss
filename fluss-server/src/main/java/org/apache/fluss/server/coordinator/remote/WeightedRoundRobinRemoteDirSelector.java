/**
 * Weighted Round-robin remote data dir selector using Interleaved (Smooth) Weighted Round-Robin
 * algorithm.
 *
 * <p>This implementation uses the smooth weighted round-robin algorithm (also known as interleaved
 * weighted round-robin), which distributes selections more evenly compared to traditional weighted
 * round-robin. Instead of selecting the same node consecutively based on its weight, it interleaves
 * selections to achieve a smoother distribution.
 *
 * <p>Algorithm:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>Each node maintains a currentWeight initialized to 0
 *   <li>On each selection: add the node's configured weight to its currentWeight
 *   <li>Select the node with the highest currentWeight
 *   <li>Subtract the total weight sum from the selected node's currentWeight
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>Example: For nodes A, B, C with weights 5, 1, 1 (total=7), the selection sequence would be: A,
 * A, B, A, C, A, A (instead of A, A, A, A, A, B, C in traditional WRR).
