 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Per-target</b>: {@link #listOk()} reports whether the {@code LIST_REMOTE_LOG_MANIFESTS}
 *       RPC succeeded. When it fails the per-bucket axis is meaningless and the caller should emit
 *       a single per-target skip and bypass the per-bucket loop entirely.
 *   <li><b>Per-bucket</b>: {@link #statusFor(int)} reports one of {@link
 *       ManifestReadStatus#RESOLVED}, {@link ManifestReadStatus#READ_FAILED}, or {@link
 *       ManifestReadStatus#NOT_LISTED} for every bucket enumerated from table metadata. Only
 *       meaningful when {@link #listOk()} is true.
