# Secrets in Configuration

Configuration values such as credentials for lake catalogs or object storage do not need to be
written into `server.yaml` (or client configuration) as literals. Instead, a value can be an
**indirection marker** that points at an external source, and Fluss resolves it at load time:

```yaml title="conf/server.yaml"
config.providers: directory,env
config.providers.directory.param.allowed.paths: /etc/fluss/secrets

# read from the file /etc/fluss/secrets/s3-secret-key
datalake.paimon.s3.secret-key: ${directory:/etc/fluss/secrets:s3-secret-key}
# read from an environment variable
datalake.paimon.s3.access-key: ${env:PAIMON_S3_ACCESS_KEY}
```

This keeps the configuration file free of secret material, so it can be checked into version
control or shipped as a plain Kubernetes ConfigMap while the secrets live in a mounted
`Secret` volume or injected environment variables.

## Markers

A marker has the form `${provider:[path:]key}` and must be the **entire** configuration value;
markers embedded inside larger values are not resolved. To use a literal value that starts with
`${`, escape it by doubling the dollar sign: `$${literal}` becomes `${literal}`. The escape, like
marker resolution, only applies when `config.providers` is set.

Resolution happens once, when the configuration is loaded: on server startup, when a client
connection is created via `ConnectionFactory`, and when the lake tiering service parses its
arguments. Rotating a secret requires a restart of the affected process. Markers are rejected in
dynamically altered cluster configuration. If a value looks like a marker but `config.providers`
is not set, it is kept as a literal and a warning is logged.

## Providers

Providers are enabled explicitly with `config.providers`; a marker referencing a provider that is
not declared fails the startup. Provider parameters are passed as
`config.providers.<identifier>.param.<parameter>`.

| Provider | Marker | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `directory` | `${directory:/dir:file}` | Reads the content of `/dir/file` verbatim (UTF-8). Matches a Kubernetes `Secret` mounted as a volume, where each secret key becomes a file. |
| `env` | `${env:VAR}` | Reads an environment variable, e.g. one injected via `secretKeyRef`. |
| `file` | `${file:/path/creds.properties:key}` | Reads a single property from a Java properties file. |

The filesystem-reading providers (`directory`, `file`) require the `allowed.paths` parameter — a
comma-separated list of roots they may read from. A marker resolving to a file outside every root
is rejected, so a stray marker cannot read arbitrary files. The `env` provider optionally accepts
`allowlist.pattern`, a regular expression the variable name must match.

Custom providers can be added by implementing
`org.apache.fluss.config.provider.ConfigProvider` and registering the implementation for
Java `ServiceLoader` discovery. The provider must be visible to the classloader that loads Fluss
itself: place the jar on the server classpath (`lib/`), or bundle it with the Fluss connector for
Flink jobs. Plugin directories are not scanned.

## Kubernetes example

When deploying with the Helm chart, the `secrets.mounts` / `secrets.env` values generate all of
the below — see
[Deploying with Helm](../install-deploy/deploying-with-helm.md#secrets-in-configuration-overrides).

```yaml
# server.yaml shipped as a plain ConfigMap — contains no secrets
config.providers: directory
config.providers.directory.param.allowed.paths: /etc/fluss/secrets
datalake.paimon.s3.secret-key: ${directory:/etc/fluss/secrets:s3-secret-key}
```

```yaml
# pod spec: the secret is a normal Secret volume, never part of the ConfigMap
volumes:
  - name: fluss-secrets
    secret:
      secretName: fluss-paimon-creds
containers:
  - name: tablet-server
    volumeMounts:
      - name: fluss-secrets
        mountPath: /etc/fluss/secrets
        readOnly: true
```

Values resolved through a provider are treated as sensitive and are hidden when the configuration
is logged, regardless of the key name.
